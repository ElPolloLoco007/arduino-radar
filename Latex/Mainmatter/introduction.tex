\chapter{Introduction}
In this project we are going to work with an Arduino Uno microcomputer and a variety of components to create a small-scale radar. This to get a small understanding of the Arduino and the possibilities it comes with.  

The Arduino programming comes with some number of pre-set libraries, but they haven't always got the most satisfying codes for the project. Therefore, one has sometimes to write new codes, which we will also see in this project. 

From this point on $on$ and $off$ are going to be used instead of $start$ and $stop$. This to indicate that the radar is being turned on and off, but the Arduino Uno itself is not being turned on and off.
