\chapter{Conclusion}
Looking back on the project we have been through a learning curve, a learning curve involving Arduino software and hardware, especially getting hardware and software working together has been a steep learning curve, since it has proven to be hard to get all the components working together and as intended, since the coding didn't always seem logical. 

The majority of the hardware components are fairly simple, but when looking at the LCD display and the Ultrasonic sensor proved to be a challenge to understand their nature. Regarding the coding the challenge again showed itself regarding the same components as with the hardware, but here especially the programming of the push button proved to be a challenge, since it isn't logical or in other words it isn't a switch, but we want it to work as one. 

The radar itself is now up and running, it doesn’t work perfectly as a modern radar, since it’s a school project and with the time given there is no chance to get it to the standards of a modern radar. But as a school project it is satisfying, and we are able to show the principle of a radar and we have gotten some insight in how Arduino can be used in the modern society
